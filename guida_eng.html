					<h1>Villaggio Sole Ruiu - Olbia - Appartamento Diamanti 7</h1>
					<p>Welcome to our little house in the Sole Ruiu residence. Below, we will provide you with some directions that we hope can make your stay even more enjoyable.</p>
					<h2>The Apartment</h2>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Wi-Fi: It is located in its box above the dresser at the entrance. To use it, simply turn it on by pressing the dedicated button. The network name is WebPocket-EB79. The password is written under the device. If it runs out of battery, you can recharge it with the provided cable always found in the box. 
						<strong>At the end of your stay, please turn off the device and store it in its box.</strong></li>

						<li>All windows and French doors are equipped with <strong>mosquito nets</strong>, even though the village undergoes periodic treatments.</br></li>
						<li>Be cautious about securing the <strong>shutters</strong> (especially those of the loft room) using the appropriate hooks (in Sardinia, the wind is strong).</br></li>

						<li>In the loft area, there is a De'Longhi Penguin <strong>(air conditioner / inverter)</strong> with an instruction booklet that you will find in the brown wicker container with the duck placed near the blue wardrobe.</br></li>
						<li>The <strong>washing machine</strong> is located under the burners, and the instruction booklet is placed on top of the washing machine itself. There is also a drying rack for laundry next to the refrigerator. You will also find an iron and ironing board.</br></li>

						<li>To have hot water, it is necessary to turn on the <strong>boiler</strong> (switch on the external wall next to the bathroom door).</br></li>
						<li>The <strong>electric panel</strong> is located on the wall inside the built-in wardrobe upon entering the house on the right.</br></li>
						<li>For your breakfast or a small "Italian" break, you will find the coffee machine with compatible Nespresso pods.</br></li>
						<li>The kitchen (complete with dishes, glasses, cutlery) has two induction burners and a refrigerator with a freezer. It is also equipped with a small electric oven, a food warmer, and an electric barbecue.
						(Caution: before turning on the electric barbecue, you need to put a bit of water in the tray under the grill)</li>
						<li>Bed sheets, towels, and beach towels are at your disposal in the built-in wardrobe at the entrance, and there are two small beach umbrellas in the external cabinet outside the entrance of the house.</li>
						<li>The most common detergents are under the sink. There is also a hairdryer in the bathroom.</li>
						<strong>Caution:</strong></br>

						<strong>- The water throughout the village comes from a cistern, so it is advisable not to drink it.</strong></br>
						<strong>- Waste collection is differentiated, and there are specific containers placed under the kitchen sink (for organic waste) and in the entrance courtyard for paper, glass, and plastic. Please dispose of the waste regularly and, in any case, before your departure, take the trash to the designated bin located in the square in front of the central sports area.</strong></br>

					</ul>

<h2>Village and Surroundings</h2>

<p>
The <strong>parking space</strong> assigned to our apartment is not marked but is in the area to the right just after the uphill ramp, in position 4 (in practice, the second-to-last position).</br></br>
In the village, there is a common <strong>sports area</strong> with tennis courts, soccer field, and a <strong>pool</strong>. You have free access to the pool (swimming cap required) for a maximum of 4 people: upon entering, you should inform the lifeguard that you are guests of the Vinci-Diamanti family 7. The pool has the following hours 09:30-13:00 / 15:00-19:30. In the pool area, there is also a refreshment point (bar van).</br></br>

The most convenient <strong>supermarket</strong> (IPERCONAD) is located at the Terranova shopping center about 10 minutes by car from the residence: take the SS orientale sarda 125 towards Olbia, at the first large roundabout continue towards Olbia and then turn right following the signs Olbia â€“ via Aldo Moro. You can find a Dettori supermarket (excellent fresh pasta) going towards the beaches, at the junction for Marinella Beach (about 15 minutes from the residence).</br></br>

Please observe the period of silence (from 23:00 to 08:00).</br>
It is forbidden to organize parties/events.</br>
<strong>For any issues, contact Mr. Piero at the mobile number +39 349 609 0220</strong>.</br>
</p>
<h2>Beaches and Places to Visit</h2>

<p>
The nearest beaches are Marinella (about 15 minutes) and Cala Sabina (20 minutes) heading towards Golfo Aranci, Rena Bianca, and Razza di Junco (same distance) heading towards Porto Cervo. Following are the most beautiful beaches of Costa Smeralda, such as Liscia Ruja and Petra Ruja (the latter a real gem, a bit of a walk to reach it but very sheltered from the wind and less crowded), Principe Beach, Romazzino, Capriccioli, and the beaches of Porto Liccia.</br></br>
For all these destinations, as soon as you reach the intersection with the SS orientale sarda 125, turn right and then at the roundabout take the second exit. Then follow the appropriate signs.</br></br>
Heading towards the city of Olbia, you will find the beach of Pittulongu (well indicated by road signs), the beach of Olbiesi, wide and with bars and restaurants (20 minutes).</br></br>
Continuing beyond Olbia Airport, you will find the beaches of Porto San Paolo, Porto Taverna, etc., beautiful, with the island of Tavolara in front.</br></br>
The beaches of Cala Brandinchi (known as Tahiti) and Lu Impostu are worth a visit: access is free but by online reservation on the website "Le spiagge di San Teodoro." On reservation and for a fee, there's the oasis of Biderosa in Orosei.
Taking the SS orientale sarda 125 in the other direction (turning left at the exit of the Sole Ruiu road) leads towards Arzachena, to reach the beaches of Cannigione or to go towards Palau, from where excursions to the Maddalena Islands depart.</br></br>
Absolutely advisable, especially in the late afternoon and evening hours (shops are open until late), to visit the village of San Pantaleo, which is about 15 minutes from the residence by taking the SS 125 towards Arzachena and turning right after a few kilometers towards San Pantaleo. Also worth seeing are the weekly markets (Monday in Golfo Aranci, Wednesday in Porto Rotondo and Arzachena, Friday at Li Neuli Country Club, and Saturday in Olbia on Via Moro).</br></br>
